# Timedcodingquiz

## Description

This is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This app was created to help gain experience with web browser APIs and how to use the DOM to manipulate the HTML and CSS.

The JavaScript quiz app was developed by David Patzer as part of the NU coding bootcamp. I obtained information from many sources to help put this together. This includes w3collective, MDN for array methods and event listers, Stack Overflow, https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/library/how-to-create-a-quiz-app-using-javascript, YouTube video 'Build a Quiz App with JavaScript', from Web Dev Simplified, YouTube Video 'Create a Quiz App with Timer using HTML CSS & JavaScript | Quiz Web App using JavaScript' from Coding Nepal. I also used ChatGPT to check the code.
